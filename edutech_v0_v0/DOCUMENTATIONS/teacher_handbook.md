**Formula:** `((Average Controls + Sum of Exams) / (Number of Exams + 1)) × Coefficient`

**Components:**
- **Controls:** Regular assessments, quizzes, classwork
- **Exams:** Major tests, mid-term, final exams
- **Coefficient:** Subject weight (set by manager)

**Example:**
- Controls: 12, 14, 13 → Average = 13
- Exams: 15, 16 → Sum = 31, Count = 2
- Coefficient: 2
- **Final Grade:** `((13 + 31) / (2 + 1)) × 2 = 29.33`
